## Microorganisms + Mycelium


**Monday - Microbial Wonder with Maro Pebo + Bacterial Dyes**


Maro's lecture on 'Microbial Wonder' was very eye opening for me. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about how decentralising the human perspective, in this case my own, of a city to start considering and viewing cities from the persepctive of other organisms such as microorganisms like lichen. I used to have a tendency to view the organisms that I've worked with such as SCOBY and mold as my material, but after this lecture I noticed a shift of my perspective to start viewing them as collaborators and to learn how to work alongside them not for my own benefit but instead for it to be a symbiotic relationship. 

Afterwards, we conducted our own experiments of dying fabrics and yarns with Janthinobacterium, which presents itself as a dark purple. We did two tests with different mediums (LB and Standard Nutrient Agar) with slight drops of glycerine to enhance the growth of the bacteria, Within those tests we used synthetic and natural fabrics + yarns. I decided to use LB and yarn with the hope of creating a textile, however, after keeping the yarn in the incubator for three weeks, the growth was sparse and perhaps the balls of yarn were to tightly wrapped. We also later learned that the presence of glucose actually inhibits the growth of the janthinobacterium which was the reason the tests with standard nutrient agar didn't produce the purple colour.
