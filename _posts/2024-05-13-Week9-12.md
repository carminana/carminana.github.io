## Personal Project


**Week 9 (13.05-16.05)- Collection + Processing**

I initially collected my oysters from a popular restaurant and after finishing that batch I started to look for another place to collect oysters from as the place was not as responsive about me collecting their waste. I contacted more restaurants and was able to find a place that let me collect about 2kg+ of oysters which I started the cleaning procedure for the next day. The cleaning procedure is as follows:

- Rinse through --> this is done before the oysters go into the autoclave to ensure that there are no other organisms (of course except for those attached to the shell) going into the autoclave
- Autoclave --> to ensure that shells are sterilised
- Vinegar bath --> I applied the acetic acid method used in capiz extraction as another layer of cleaning the shells and I learned from the initial samples that I made that the vinegar also helps produce a closer shade similar to porcelain as it removes any 


 Aside from this source, Isabel (a participant of the BioHack Academy living in Belgium) reached out and offered to collect shells from Zeeland from me and kindly shipped a box with 10kgs worth of oyster shells. That same day I began the same process I did with the previous batches but had to scale up largely.


**Week 10 (21.05-24.05) - Processing + Testing**



**Week 11 (28.05-31.05) - Testing + Samples**



**Week 12 (03.06-06.06) - Painting**
