## Personal Project


**Week 9 (13.05-16.05)- Collection + Processing**

I initially collected my oysters from a popular restaurant (Batch1) and after finishing that batch I started to look for another place to collect oysters from as the place was not as responsive about me collecting their waste. I contacted more restaurants and was able to find a place that let me collect about 2kg+ of oysters (Batch2) which I started the cleaning procedure for the next day. The cleaning procedure is as follows:

- Rinse through --> this is done before the oysters go into the autoclave to ensure that there are no other organisms (of course except for those attached to the shell) going into the autoclave
- Autoclave --> to ensure that shells are sterilised
- Vinegar bath --> I applied the acetic acid method used in capiz extraction as another layer of cleaning the shells and I learned from the initial samples that the vinegar also removes the colouring on the shells leaving them white. I found that when comparing the vinegar soaked oyster shells to  simply dehydrated ones, the colour of the shell powder when created into a tile sample has a closer resemblance to porcelain. The vinegar bath usually last 24 hours to allows the hard shells ample time to soften.
- Brush + Dry --> After the soak I do a last cleanse by brushing off all remaining sediment and external growths that have softened a bit more. The end product is a beautifully cleaned and pearlescent oyster shell ready to be processed. I then place the shells in a dehydrator to remove any excess moisture that might be lingering around. *This step is particularly helpful because when crushing the shells you're looking to extract a dry powder and sometimes there is trapped moisture in the thicker layers of shells. This just requires a second round of dehydrating (which I tried to avoid as I was on a time constrain)* 

For the second batch I collected from the redtuarant I used around 7L of vinegar.

 Aside from using the local restaurants as a source for oysters I was planning to go to the Hague to collect them myself or look for more restaurants there, Thankfully, Isabel (a participant of the BioHack Academy living in Belgium) reached out and offered to collect shells from Zeeland for me and kindly shipped a box with 10kgs worth of oyster shells (Batch3). The day of their arrival I began the process mentioned above. When it came to the vinegar soak I was a little stumped because of the quantity I had to process, however, I found a contained that could fit them all and I used around 18.5L of vinegar. 

I took home Batch2 to start processing with a mortar and pestle as well as a spice grinder (these were the pieces of equipmet I used for the samples) and decided I would need more assistance and bought a food processor which broke within 3hrs of using it. Unfortunately I didn't get too far with working at home that weekened but I did indeed buy a hammer, gloves, and safety glasses and was completely prepared to try a different approach the following week.

**Week 10 (21.05-24.05) - Processing + Testing**

I started this week crushing oyster shells with a hammer outside the Waag. The sun was out, which was great because I needed to be outside to do this, but I don't think I ever expected to sweat so much during this project. I was able to complete crushing Batch3 that day and finished Batch2 the following day, where I also was able to begin sifting through the pieces to sort what I could use as a fine and coarse powder. It's important for me to note that during the processing of Batch2+3 I had been instructed to wear a mask due to the prescence of heavy metals in the oyster shells. I would like to extend this recommendation to anyone else who would like to explore using and extracting from oyster shells. 

Like the cleaning and processing of the oyster shells, the sifting also took a while. I learned that listening to music that makes you happy or dance was very helpful and ALMOST made the tedious tasks fun. to do very tedious tasks 


**Week 11 (28.05-31.05) - Testing + Samples**



**Week 12 (03.06-06.06) - Painting**
